    """
    Matching Pursuit Sparse Autoencoder (MpSAE).

    This autoencoder uses a greedy Matching Pursuit strategy to obtain sparse
    codes. Specifically, at each iteration the dictionary atom most correlated
    with the current residual is chosen and its contribution is subtracted
    from the residual. This process is repeated k times. An optional dropout
    can be applied on the dictionary elements at each iteration.
    Warning: for this SAE, the encoding is returning (1) the residual and (2) the
    codes -- as the pre_codes are just the input.

    Parameters
    ----------
    input_shape : int or tuple of int
        Dimensionality of the input data (excluding the batch dimension).
    nb_concepts : int
        Number of latent dimensions (components) of the autoencoder.
    k : int, optional
        The number of matching pursuit iterations to perform (must be > 0).
    dropout : float, optional
        Probability of dropping a dictionary element at each iteration
        (range: 0.0 - 1.0). If None, no dropout is applied.
    encoder_module : nn.Module or str, optional
        Custom encoder module (or its registered name). If None, a default encoder is used.
    dictionary_params : dict, optional
        Parameters that will be passed to the dictionary layer.
        See DictionaryLayer for more details.
    device : str, optional
        Device on which to run the model (default is 'cpu').

        """
        Encode input data with a greedy Matching Pursuit approach.

        The dictionary (W) is optionally subjected to dropout. Then, at each
        of k iterations:
            1) Compute the correlation (dot product) between the residual and each
               dictionary atom.
            2) Identify the maximum correlation and corresponding dictionary atom index.
            3) Update the codes by adding that contribution.
            4) Subtract the chosen atom (scaled by the correlation) from the residual.

        Parameters
        ----------
        x : torch.Tensor
            Input tensor of shape (batch_size, input_size).

        Returns

            The residual after k Matching Pursuit iterations.
